Parameters
    _query_execution_cache_max_size:  controls the hash bucket size that used for scalar subquery and pl/sql deterministic
    _plsql_cache_enable: enables plsql this caching mechanism of deterministic feature
    _plsql_minimum_cache_hit_percent: responsible for the percentage of unsuccessful attempts which disables caching, 0 to force caching
    _sqlexec_hash_based_distagg_enabled: improve multiple count(distinct) performance
    _plsql_nvl_optimize: improve nvl performance by not evaluating the second expression if the first is not null
    _gc_fast_index_split_wait: 0 to disable 'gc index operation' events (bug#28023081)
    _index_prefetch_factor – defaults to 100, but when changed smaller, the optimizer will favor index prefetching. (NLJ prefetching)
    _disable_index_block_prefetching: defaults to false, controls index prefetching (NLJ prefetching)
    _db_file_noncontig_mblock_read_count – defaults to 11, maximum number of blocks(i.e. db file parallel read) to be prefetched in one batch. If set to 1, prefetching should be disabled. (NLJ prefetching)
    _table_lookup_prefetch_thresh:  defaults as 2 and lower value makes Oracle use multiblock reads much more aggressively  (NLJ prefetching)
    _table_lookup_prefetch_size: defaults as 40 and higher value makes Oracle use multiblock reads much more aggressively (NLJ prefetching)
    _nlj_batching_enabled: defaults as 1, and 0 to turn off NLJ batching
    _sort_elimination_cost_ratio:  defaults as 0, mainly used in first_rows. If est_cost(index_scan+order_by)*ratio>est_cost(index_full_scan) then use index_range_scan+order_by. 
    _optimizer_skip_scan_enabled or hint NO_INDEX_SS: disable index skip scan
    _with_subquery: OPTIMIZER/MATERIALIZE/INLINE, impacts the default behaviour of with subquery
    _smm_auto_max_io_size: defaults to 256. used to reduce the direct path read/write temp overhead for hash join/sort
    _lm_drm_disable: defaults to 0.  1(_gc_affinity_locking): disable affinity locking,   2(_gc_undo_affinity):disable undo drm  4(_gc_read_mostly_locking): disable readmostly drm. Refer to MOS 1619155.1 for other gc parameters
    _db_hot_block_tracking: enables to collect the hot blocks in X$KSLHOT
    _restrict_pdb_gv: false to disable cross-instance query on gv$ views
